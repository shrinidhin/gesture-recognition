# gesture-recognition
Model to recognize 5 different gestures and perform actions based on each gesture

The objective is to develop a model for gesture recognition of 5 different ypes of models.The jupyter notebook contains code for two different types of architectures used for building the model:The standard CNN+RNN architecture and the other is a Convolutional 3D layer architecture.

The pdf file is a detailed writeup that contains the experiments done and the steps followed to arrive at the final models for both architecture and hence decide on the best architecture for this problem statement.
